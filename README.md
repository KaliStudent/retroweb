A universal drop-in replacement SDK that aims to allow **any** Base44 project to migrate to self-hosted Supabase infrastructure with **zero code changes** required.

## ✨ Goals

- ✅ **Zero Code Changes Required** - Works with any Base44 app immediately
- ✅ **Universal Compatibility** - Automatically discovers and supports all Base44 entities
- ✅ **100% API Compatibility** - All existing Base44 code works unchanged
- ✅ **Intelligent Entity Management** - Automatically creates entities on-demand
- ✅ **Smart Security** - Automatically applies appropriate security policies
- ✅ **Uses Supabase (PostgreSQL)** as the backend database
- ✅ **Multiple Deployment Options** (Cloudflare Pages, Vercel, self-hosted)
- ✅ **Enhanced Security** with Row Level Security (RLS)
- ✅ **Real-time Capabilities** and advanced querying
- ✅ **Eliminates Vendor Lock-in** and reduces costs significantly

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
```

### 2. Copy SDK Files

Copy these files to your Base44 project:

```
src/lib/
├── supabase-client.js    # Supabase connection setup
└── custom-sdk.js         # Universal custom SDK implementation

src/api/
└── base44Client.js       # Universal drop-in replacement
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
```

### 4. Create Database Schema

Set up your Supabase database with tables matching your Base44 entities (see full guide below).

**That's it!** Your existing Base44 code now works with Supabase.

## 🎯 How It Works

The SDK uses intelligent proxies to automatically discover and create entities:

```javascript
// Your existing Base44 code works unchanged
import { BlogPost, User, YourCustomEntity } from "./src/api/entities";

// SDK automatically:
// BlogPost → creates CustomEntity("blog_posts")
// YourCustomEntity → creates CustomEntity("your_custom_entities")
// Applies appropriate security policies automatically

const posts = await BlogPost.list(); // Works immediately
const user = await User.me(); // Works immediately
const custom = await YourCustomEntity.create(data); // Works immediately
```

### 🚧 Placeholder Implementations (Require Setup)

**Integration Functions:**

- 🚧 **InvokeLLM** - Placeholder with OpenAI implementation guide
- 🚧 **SendEmail** - Placeholder with Resend/SendGrid implementation guide
- 🚧 **UploadFile** - Placeholder with Supabase Storage implementation guide
- 🚧 **GenerateImage** - Placeholder with DALL-E implementation guide
- 🚧 **ExtractDataFromUploadedFile** - Placeholder with OCR implementation guide

**Custom Functions:**

- 🚧 **verifyHcaptcha** - Returns mock success, needs hCaptcha API integration

### 📝 Implementation Notes

**Integration Functions Status:**
All integration functions are implemented as intelligent placeholders that:

- Accept the correct parameters matching Base44 API
- Return properly formatted responses
- Include detailed TODO comments with implementation guidance
- Provide mock responses for development/testing

**To Implement Integrations:**

1. **InvokeLLM**: Replace placeholder with OpenAI API calls
2. **SendEmail**: Replace placeholder with Resend, SendGrid, or similar service
3. **UploadFile**: Replace placeholder with Supabase Storage implementation
4. **GenerateImage**: Replace placeholder with DALL-E, Stability AI, or similar
5. **ExtractDataFromUploadedFile**: Replace placeholder with OCR service

**Why Placeholders?**

- Keeps the SDK lightweight and dependency-free
- Allows you to choose your preferred service providers
- Maintains 100% API compatibility during development
- Provides clear implementation guidance

### 🔄 Migration Compatibility

**What Works Immediately:**

- All entity operations (list, filter, get, create, update, delete)
- User authentication and session management
- Database queries and relationships
- Field mapping and data transformation

**What Needs Implementation:**

- Third-party service integrations (email, AI, file storage)
- Custom business logic functions
- Advanced real-time features (optional)

**Perfect For:**

- **E-commerce sites**: Product pages, category pages, and landing pages
- **Content sites**: Blog posts, articles, and marketing pages
- **SaaS applications**: Landing pages, pricing pages, and public content
- **Any app**: Where specific routes need better SEO or faster initial loads

**Benefits:**

- 🚀 **Faster initial page loads** - Content renders immediately, no loading spinners
- 📈 **Better SEO rankings** - Search engines see fully rendered content
- 📊 **Improved Core Web Vitals** - Better Lighthouse scores and user experience
- 🎯 **Selective optimization** - Only convert routes that actually benefit from SSR
- 🔄 **Zero code changes** - Your existing Base44 code works unchanged

**Example Configuration:**

```javascript
// base44-ssr.config.js
ssrRoutes: [
  { path: "/", preload: ["BlogPost.list({ limit: 5 })"] },
  { path: "/products/:id", preload: ["Product.get(params.id)"] },
  { path: "/blog/:slug", preload: ["BlogPost.filter({ slug: params.slug })"] },
];
```
